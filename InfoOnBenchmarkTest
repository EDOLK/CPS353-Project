The computation was first updated to properly compute a factorial sum. Before, 
it was only computing a factorial, which was not the goal of the program. Then,
a concurrent version of it was created that stored previously done computations
in a treemap to make future computations faster. When the new version is ran after 
the concurrent version, it is optimized, which is why the performance is significantly 
improved. The pull request for the concurrent version can be found here:
